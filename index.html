            <p>
            My name is Liliana, and I'm currently a student and working towards getting a coding certificate! 
            I have been stationed in front of a computer screen since I was a child; 
            starting with trying to figure out how to play "Minesweeper" as a child, (and failing) 
            to growing up and working with a friend to build my own computer, 
            the intricacies of the ever evolving technology around me has always called my attention and interest. 
            I truly enjoy being creative and creating, I have been crocheting, embroydering, and painting for as long as I can remember.
            I also am an avid reader of any and all media. 
            I am very politically active in my community and have been canvassing, 
            campaining and registering voter in the state of Texas for the past three years. 
            All and all, I am very passionate about the things I care about and I am never one to turn down a challenge!
